abstract = {This paper builds spatial models of Bronze Age settlement using published survey datasets from the Mirabello region in east Crete. Methodologically, we examine how point process modelling can account for uncertainties in legacy survey datasets, and thereafter can highlight patterns of both cultural change and continuity in Mirabello settlement. Comparison of fitted models over different chronological periods gives an insight, we argue, into the kinds of settlement and subsistence choices that lay behind settlement patterns, holding constant the broadly similar environmental constraints faced by inhabitants throughout the Bronze Age. Overall, the results suggest prehistoric preference for, and exploitation of, agriculturally favourable parts of the landscape, although contrasting emphases in different periods do emerge despite this unsurprising overall preference. Many of the analytical results prove robust to a sensitivity analysis which addresses commonplace uncertainties associated with settlement survey data. The results also dovetail well with previous archaeological interpretations of changing settlement and Bronze Age life in the Mirabello region. Survey datasets are also relatively common in other archaeological settings worldwide and we advocate for more widespread application of similarly formalised methods to them.},

abstract = {Migration is arguably one of the most important processes that link ecological and social systems across scales. Humans (and other organisms) tend to move in pursuit of better resources (both social and environmental). Such mobility may serve as a coping mechanism for short-term local-scale dilemmas and as a means of distributing organisms in relation to resources. Movement also may be viewed as a shift to a larger scale; that is, while it may solve short-term local problems, it may simultaneously have longer term and larger scale consequences. We conduct a quantitative analysis using dynamic modeling motivated by an archaeological case study to explore the dynamics that arise when population movement serves as a link between spatial scales. We use the model to characterize how ecological and social factors can lead to spatial variation in resource exploitation, and to investigate the circumstances under which migration may enhance or reduce the capacity of the system to absorb shocks at different scales.},

abstract = {Regular grids or lattices are frequently used to study ecosystems, for observations, experiments and simulations. The regular rectangular or square grid is used more often than the hexagonal grid, but their relative merits have been little discussed. Here we compare rectangular and hexagonal grids for ecological applications. We focus on the reasons some researchers have preferred hexagonal grids and methods to facilitate the use of hexagonal grids. We consider modelling and other applications, including the role of nearest neighbourhood in experimental design, the representation of connectivity in maps, and a new method for performing field surveys using hexagonal grids, which was demonstrated on montane heath vegetation. The rectangular grid is generally preferred because of its symmetrical, orthogonal co-ordinate system and the frequent use of rasters from Geographic Information Systems. Cells in a rectangular grid can also easily be combined to produce new grids with lower resolutions. However, efficient co-ordinate systems and multi-resolution partitions using the hexagonal grid are available. The nearest neighbourhood in a hexagonal grid is simpler and less ambiguous than in a rectangular grid. When nearest neighbourhood, movement paths or connectivity are important, the rectangular grid may not be suitable. We also investigate important differences between visualizations using hexagonal and rectangular grids. A survey of recent uses of grids in Ecological Modelling suggested that hexagonal grids are rarely used, even in applications for which they are more suitable than rectangular grids, e.g. connectivity and movement paths. Researchers should consider their choice of grid at an early stage in project development, and authors should explain the reasons for their choices. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Simulations of spatial interaction in archaeology have been successful in predicting the emergence of central sites, and political and economic hierarchies that match observed long-term settlement patterns. It still remains unclear, however, to what degree such models can effectively allow for uncertainty in the archaeological record, especially when it comes to incomplete and unevenly distributed settlement data, and how best they might incorporate artefact-scale evidence. This paper aims to address these issues, while attempting to tackle widely debated aspects of socio-political organisation and cultural interaction in the prehistoric Cretan landscape at the period immediately before and after the foundation of the first palace of Phaistos, one of the less well documented Bronze Age phases. We employ a simulation of spatial interaction inspired by approaches first developed in urban geography and combine this with regression-based predictive modelling to address the uncertainty introduced by missing settlements. We use evidence from artefact analysis partly to calibrate and partly to validate our model. We conclude that such an approach can contribute to more convincing archaeological theories about socio-political organisation, cultural affinity and regional identity by providing new evidence even in the presence of very fragmented data.},

abstract = {The landscapes of the Near East show both the first settlements and the longest trajectories of settlement systems. Mounding is a characteristic property of these settlement sites, resulting from millennia of continuing settlement activity at distinguished places. So far, however, this defining feature of ancient settlements has not received much attention, or even been the subject of systematic evaluation. We propose a remote sensing approach for comprehensively mapping the pattern of human settlement at large scale and establish the largest archaeological record for a landscape in Mesopotamia, mapping about 14,000 settlement sites--spanning eight millennia--at 15-m resolution in a 23,000-km(2) area in northeastern Syria. To map both low- and high-mounded places--the latter of which are often referred to as "tells"--we develop a strategy for detecting anthrosols in time series of multispectral satellite images and measure the volume of settlement sites in a digital elevation model. Using this volume as a proxy to continued occupation, we find a dependency of the long-term attractiveness of a site on local water availability, but also a strong relation to the relevance within a basin-wide exchange network that we can infer from our record and third millennium B.C. intersite routes visible on the ground until recent times. We believe it is possible to establish a nearly comprehensive map of human settlements in the fluvial plains of northern Mesopotamia and beyond, and site volume may be a key quantity to uncover long-term trends in human settlement activity from such a record.},

It is demonstrated that urban techniques can be used for incorporating spatial competition effects into such models in novel ways, and that the complex dynamics can then be effectively interpreted. Urban systems have contributed significantly to complexity theory in the past-because they are complicated enough to be interesting but simple enough to be solvable. These insights can now be transferred to complex (spatial) ecosystems. The possibility of joint eco-urban models is explored.},

abstract = {In his classic work, Pigs for the Ancestors, Roy Rappaport proposed that the ritual cycle of the Tsembaga was a mechanism to regulate human population growth and prevent the degradation of the Tsembaga ecosystem. Rappaport provided detailed ethnographic and ecological information to support his claim, but many aspects of Rappaport's model were subsequently criticised. Several simulation models of the Tsembaga ecosystem were constructed to test Rappaport's hypothesis (Shantzis {\&} Behrens, 1973; Foin {\&} Davis, 1984) and evaluate possible alternatives (e.g. Foin {\&} Davis, 1987). The basic conclusions were that it was possible to develop models supporting Rappaport's hypothesis but they were extremely sensitive to parameter choices, and other simpler population control mechanisms might be more likely (Buchbinder, 1977; Foin {\&} Davis, 1987). In this paper, a much simpler dynamical system model for a slash-and-burn agricultural system is developed and applied to the Tsembaga system. By analysing the structure of the model for different physical and socioeconomic conditions, sources of instability and possible stabilising mechanisms are identified. The model indicates that behavioral plasticity (ability to modify behavior over a wide range of behavioral options, quickly and easily) is a fundamental source of instability which is strong enough to nullify more direct stabilising influences such as malnutrition and disease. This suggests that the only possible mechanism to counter to this fundamentally destabilising force may be cultural, i.e. the ritual cycle. Finally, a condition is outlined for which the ritual cycle will produce (local) stability.},

abstract = {The variational principles called maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and maximum caliber (MaxCal) are reviewed. MaxEnt originated in the statistical physics of Boltzmann and Gibbs, as a theoretical tool for predicting the equilibrium states of thermal systems. Later, entropy maximization was also applied to matters of information, signal transmission, and image reconstruction. Recently, since the work of Shore and Johnson, MaxEnt has been regarded as a principle that is broader than either physics or information alone. MaxEnt is a procedure that ensures that inferences drawn from stochastic data satisfy basic self-consistency requirements. The different historical justifications for the entropy S=-∑ipilog⁡pi and its corresponding variational principles are reviewed. As an illustration of the broadening purview of maximum entropy principles, maximum caliber, which is path entropy maximization applied to the trajectories of dynamical systems, is also reviewed. Examples are given in which maximum caliber is used to interpret dynamical fluctuations in biology and on the nanoscale, in single-molecule and few-particle systems such as molecular motors, chemical reactions, biological feedback circuits, and diffusion in microfluidics devices.},

Secondly, these ideas are applied to a model of the evolution in transport networks. Thirdly, it is shown that such a model can be translated into a planning context and the notion of an explicitly hierarchical dynamic model is introduced. An example of the use of such a model of evolution within a network planning context is presented. This explores the planning of network evolution in a case study of Naples arising from a new harbour which is under construction. The model provides a new method for transport system planning through combining the insights from dynamic modelling, particularly with respect to the sequencing of investment, with the practicalities of budget constraints. {\textcopyright} 2014 Pion and its Licensors.},

abstract = {Land surface processes modulate the severity of heat waves, droughts, and other extreme events. However, models show contrasting effects of land surface changes on extreme temperatures. Here, we use an earth system model from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory to investigate regional impacts of land use and land cover change on combined extremes of temperature and humidity, namely aridity and moist enthalpy, quantities central to human physiological experience of near-surface climate. The model's near-surface temperature response to deforestation is consistent with recent observations, and conversion of mid-latitude natural forests to cropland and pastures is accompanied by an increase in the occurrence of hot-dry summers from once-in-a-decade to every 2–3 years. In the tropics, long time-scale oceanic variability precludes determination of how much of a small, but significant, increase in moist enthalpy throughout the year stems from the model's novel representation of historical patterns of wood harvesting, shifting cultivation, and regrowth of secondary vegetation and how much is forced by internal variability within the tropical oceans. Land use and land cover change has led to more frequent hot, dry summers in parts of the mid-latitudes. Here the authors use an Earth system model to show that regions converted to crops and pastures experience hot, dry summers 2 to 4 times more frequently than they would if native forests had remained.},

abstract = {Future climate change will impose increased variability on food production and food trading networks. However, the effect of climate variability and sudden shocks on resource availability through trade and its subsequent effect on population growth is largely unknown. Here we study the effect of resource variability and network topology on access to resources and population growth, using a model of population growth limited by resource availability in a trading network. Resources are redistributed in the network based on supply and the distance between nodes (i.e. cities or countries). Resources at nodes vary over time with wave parameters that mimic changes in biomass production arising from known climate variability. Random perturbations to resources are applied to study resilience of individual nodes and the system as a whole. The model demonstrates that redistribution of resources increases the maximum population that can be supported (carrying capacity) by the network. Fluctuations in carrying capacity depend on the amplitude and frequency of resource variability: fluctuations become larger for increasing amplitude and decreasing frequency. Our study shows that topology is the key factor determining the carrying capacity of a node. In larger networks the carrying capacity increases and the distribution of resources in the network becomes more equal. The most central nodes achieve a higher carrying capacity than nodes with a lower centrality. Moreover, central nodes are less susceptible to long-term resource variability and shocks. These insights can be used to understand how worldwide equitable access to resources can be maintained under increasing climate variability.},

abstract = {A key theoretical development in the history of spatial interaction modelling was provided by B. Harris and A.G. Wilson (1978). They were the first to embed spatial interaction models within a dynamic framework to test ideas concerning the development and evolution of urban spatial structures. Many of these tests were conducted through 'numerical experiments'. The aim of this paper is to review progress with real empirical applications of dynamic spatial interaction models. Three very different case studies are presented. First, the use of the models to replicate historical structural change in retail development in Leeds, UK, since the 1960s. Second, the use of the models to evaluate the future statistical stability of particular bank branches in Toronto, Canada. Third, the use of the models to explore future likely change in education provision in Leeds, UK, given the new market conditions prevalent in contemporary UK education. These case studies will show that the dynamic model can be a useful applied tool in understanding and shaping past and future urban structures. However, such detailed empirical work also leads to new theoretical developments of the original dynamic models.},

Analysis of aerial photographs supplemented by ground survey has been the traditional methodology employed to identify Chaco roads, but their traces have become increasingly subtle and difficult to detect in recent years due to the impacts of natural weathering, erosion, and land development. Roads that were easily visible in aerial photography and on the ground in the 1980s are now virtually invisible, underscoring the need for new, cutting-edge techniques to detect and document them. Using three case studies of the Aztec Airport Mesa Road, the Great North Road, and the Pueblo Alto Landscape, we demonstrate lidar's unprecedented ability to document known Chaco roads, discover previously undetected road segments, and produce a precise quantitative record of these rapidly vanishing features.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Policy makers dealing with complex systems oftentimes rely on "linear thinking." This is understandable due to the ease and convenience offered by the simplicity of such conceptualization. Although this line of thinking may help facilitate decision making processes, it is only as defensible as the degree at which the system under consideration behaves linearly. Recent work shows that diverse properties of cities exhibit power-law relationships with population size. Such relationships may invalidate the reliance on linear thinking. Furthermore, in the era of globalization, resources and people move virtually freely through bounds of any confines used to define a system. We incorporate into a simple resource-population model the power-law scaling behavior and the influence of import and immigration, and investigate their effects on sustainable growth of communities. We explore through bifurcation analysis the different scenarios of how an unsustainable system could be sustained. Import can be effective if: the import exceeds a critical level and a critical mass of people populates the system. In contrast, increasing immigration alone can rescue the intrinsically unsustainable system, both directly through people entering the system and indirectly by increasing its harvesting ability, although critical values exist that cause the population to sharply rise or shrink. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

This study proposes a simple method for identifying problems in the time series of urban and rural populations of a country. The time series were fitted to a rural-urban interaction population model, and improper model coefficients indicated that the time series were questionable. The upper limit of the urbanization level was calculated to determine whether the trend of the urbanization level follows the logistic growth model. An analysis of the frequency-spectrum relationship was performed to determine whether the urbanization process is a self-organized criticality and to consolidate the low possibility for chaos in the urbanization model. Empirical analyses were conducted using data from the United States, China, and India to verify data reliability and to determine the dynamical mechanism of urbanization.

@article{Prignano2016,
abstract = {During the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, many regions were occupied by small political communities (city-states) whose form of organization could vary widely, from hierarchical to heterarchical systems to purely independent entities. The different developments in similar areas (e.g. state formation or collapse) make their political organization an attractive subject of study. We are interested in the nature of the interactions between these polities, as they reflect how things worked at that regional scale, although it is a challenging task to study those relations in a quantitative manner. However, inter-settlement terrestrial infrastructure networks constitute a great opportunity to achieve this goal. They both shape and were shaped by the societies who created them, and they are suitable to be studied quantitatively when represented as spatial (i.e. geographic) graphs. Here, we present a methodology based on network analysis and modelling to look into the reasons why terrestrial routes were configured the way they were. We devise three models inspired in simple decision-making hypotheses to investigate which mechanism was more likely to be responsible for the topology of the terrestrial infrastructure network. In particular, we apply this methodology to a paradigmatic case-study (the region of southern Etruria during the Iron Age) from which we managed to build empirical networks, by means of archaeological and historical sources. We then compare the topological features of the synthetic networks generated by the models against those in the empirical systems. Our results show that a rather simple model, combining local decisions with global, integrated information of the system, is a good candidate to the task at hand. It reproduces the features of the empirical systems while remaining coherent with the historical knowledge about the Etruscan region.},

To establish a functional interpretation of the roads, GIS analy- sis put the roads and trials in the context of the greater landscape and their associated features. Spatial analysis was also supplemented with ground survey to observe the morphology of the roads and trails as well as to identify additional paths. To establish a symbolic function, habitation, and ritual sites that can be related to the road based upon a spatial analysis have been ana- lyzed along with a comparative study with Chaco Canyon.

abstract = {Models of human migration provide powerful tools to forecast the flow of migrants, measure the impact of a policy, determine the cost of physical and political frictions and more. Here, we analyse the migration of individuals from and to cities in the US, finding that city to city migration follows scaling laws, so that the city size is a significant factor in determining whether, or not, an individual decides to migrate and the city size of both the origin and destination play key roles in the selection of the destination. We observe that individuals from small cities tend to migrate more frequently, tending to move to similar-sized cities, whereas individuals from large cities do not migrate so often, but when they do, they tend to move to other large cities. Building upon these findings we develop a scaling model which describes internal migration as a two-step decision process, demonstrating that it can partially explain migration fluxes based solely on city size. We then consider the impact of distance and construct a gravity-scaling model by combining the observed scaling patterns with the gravity law of migration. Results show that the scaling laws are a significant feature of human migration and that the inclusion of scaling can overcome the limits of the gravity and the radiation models of human migration.},

abstract = {There is a long history of recognising and interpreting discontinuous change—phase transitions—in urban systems. In this paper, we use the aggregate retail model as an archetype to explore some new ideas. For example, we argue that the dependence of paths of development on initial conditions has been understudied, and we offer a new graphical analysis that demonstrates explicitly their influence on discrete change. We introduce an order parameter, and we plot this on a ‘results grid' to facilitate the discovery of possible phase transitions. We illustrate the use of these new developments with an application to London. We show how retail developers can change the ‘initial conditions' at a point in time and possibly bring about phase transitions by their actions. This also shows that it should be possible to account for the history of urban development as a sequence of initial conditions, illustrating path dependence. Secondly, the model could be deployed in relation to a new shopping zone, and the tools developed here used to calculate the minimum size of a new development in order for it to compete. We explore the ‘minimum size' idea in relation to a new shopping zone in London.},
annote = {Cities are non-linear systems, and it is understood that models of such systems in general have three characteristics:multiple equilibria, ‘path dependence' over time and phase transitions—that is abrupt change at critical parameter values cf (2).
These authors track phase transitions in urban development by changing initial parameters of retail zones (utility of individual going to a shopping zone; transport cost of going there) and then plotting trends.  This also allows them to explore urban path dependence.},

@article{Altaweel2015,
abstract = {This paper presents an agent-based complex system simulation of settlement structure change using methods derived from entropy maximization modeling. The approach is applied to model the movement of people and goods in urban settings to study how settlement size hierarchy develops. While entropy maximization is well known for assessing settlement structure change over different spatiotemporal settings, approaches have rarely attempted to develop and apply this methodology to understand how individual and household decisions may affect settlement size distributions. A new method developed in this paper allows individual decision-makers to chose where to settle based on social-environmental factors, evaluate settlements based on geography and relative benefits, while retaining concepts derived from entropy maximization with settlement size affected by movement ability and site attractiveness feedbacks. To demonstrate the applicability of the theoretical and methodological approach, case study settlement patterns from the Middle Bronze (MBA) and Iron Ages (IA) in the Iraqi North Jazirah Survey (NJS) are used. Results indicate clear differences in settlement factors and household choices in simulations that lead to settlement size hierarchies comparable to the two evaluated periods. Conflict and socio-political cohesion, both their presence and absence, are suggested to have major roles in affecting the observed settlement hierarchy. More broadly, the model is made applicable for different empirically based settings, while being generalized to incorporate data uncertainty, making the model useful for understanding urbanism from top-down and bottom-up perspectives.},

Emergence of hexagonal distributions of various sizes in a homogeneous space is predicted theoretically for core-periphery models. The existence of hexagonal distributions as stable equilibria is demonstrated by a comparative static analysis with respect to transport costs for specific core-periphery models. These distributions are the ones envisaged by central place theory and also inferred to emerge by Krugman (1996) for a core-periphery model in two dimensions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {When the known properties of the dynamics of nonlinear systems are reviewed in the context of urban and regional modelling, it is argued that this provides an important new perspective for planners—analogous to the role of DNA in biology. As a preliminary, it is shown that effective modelling of urban and regional dynamics, particularly with a view to policy and planning applications, demands the articulation of a hierarchy of models. It is then possible to identify the structural ‘DNA' for various layers which determine the dynamics and possible paths of development. This in turn allows the development of a ‘genetic planning' concept by analogy with ‘genetic medicine'.},

abstract = {This paper highlights a spatial interaction entropy maximization (SIEM) model to reproduce and understand past human settlement hierarchy in Central Anatolia (CA) and the Khabur Triangle (KT) during the Middle Bronze Age (ca. 2000-1600. BC). We propose applying SIEM to understand which sites and areas would have become prominent in this period by using known archaeological sites as point data and textual evidence for calibration purposes. The model addresses to which extent general factors such as topography, transportation, or social-ecological advantages (e.g., environmental benefits, external contacts, religion) make locations attractive for trade and settlement and why some archaeological sites become more prominent than others in the period discussed. The modelling results have been checked against the observed data from archaeological survey carried out in the KT and CA in order to explain the best fits. The results show that geography and topography can explain the growth of some main urban centres. In other cases, settlement hierarchies are generally explained by different initial advantages (endogenous or exogenous) for each site. Similar patterns are evident in CA and the KT, where movement constraint is due to political landscapes fragmented into numerous competing polities. In the KT, movement is slightly more restricted than CA, suggesting that warfare intensity is higher in open plains than in hilly and mountainous landscapes. Furthermore, SIEM is demonstrated to be useful in characterizing areas of interactions on different spatial scales in CA and the KT. Overall, the results demonstrate the advantage of SIEM model to enable researchers to account for missing empirical data, to compare settlement and interaction dynamics in different regions and to explain which underlying factors are beyond the reproducible observed patterns.},
